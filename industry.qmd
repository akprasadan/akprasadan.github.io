## Novartis PhD Fellow

See [Multistate and Joint Models](research.qmd#multistate-and-joint-models) for details about my 2 years of collaboration (Jan. 2021 through May 2022, then Spring 2025) with Novartis statisticians to model the efficacy of a cutting edge blood cancer immunotherapy using multistate and joint models.

### Featured Work

## Statistician at UPMC

At the [Karikari Laboratory](https://karikarilab.org/) headed by Dr. Thomas K. Karikari, clinicians are studying the use of biomarkers in the blood as diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These biomarkers offer a  more cost-effective and less invasive way to evaluate large populations for AD. While existing studies tend to sample from economically privileged populations, this study followed a socioeconomically disadvantaged cohort to broaden our understanding of the disease. I was one of a few statisticians helping design and implement statistical methods to explore this rich clinical data. I worked at the lab from 2024 through Summer 2025.

## Data Science Intern at Highmark Health

In the summer of 2022, I implemented a bi-level linear programming algorithm recently developed by a CMU PhD. The goal is to devise a health insurance network that can optimize patient utility while simultaneously minimizing costs.
