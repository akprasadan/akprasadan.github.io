The bar is replaced with a single line, and a point is added to the end. Tobias Stalder's submission showed the large gap in university enrollment between men and women at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). I especially liked his choice of using color in the subtitle rather than having a legend taking up unnecessary space.\n\n[^1]: [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly community 'event' (and podcast) in which data enthusiasts around the world share their data cleaning, visualizations and modelling techniques for that week's data release.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Tobias Stalder's TidyTuesday submission](HBCU_trends_gender.png){width=1181}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this post, I decided to find broader country-wide trends in university enrollments stratified by sex and make a similar plot. I visited the US government-ran [Digest of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/current_tables.asp) website ran by *The* *Institute of Education Sciences*. In Chapter 3, under section 303 (Total Fall Enrollment â€” General), I accessed Table 303.10 to see fall enrollment in the US from 1947 to 2023. The data also includes the breakdown of public versus private as well as full-time versus part-time. For now, I decided to just plot the entire time series, so I won't include the summary statistics in my plot that Tobias did (e.g., the mean is itself changing over time, so I'm not sure a global mean is very useful).\n\nBefore I dive in, let me summarize some of the important `tidyverse` skills this post covers:\n\n- Read in Excel files with the `readxl` package, and ignoring extraneous rows/columns \n- Cleaning column names with the `janitor` package and its `clean_names()` function\n- Making dumbbells and lollipops with `geom_segment()` \n- Feeding in multiple tibbles in your various `ggplot` geometries (and the `inherit.aes` argument)\n- Adding transparent background images with `geom_image()` from the `ggimage` package\n- Adding color and formatting to text in the titles/captions using the `ggtext` package\n- Changing the font with the `showtext` package \n\n\n# Data Cleaning\n\nI downloaded an `.xlsx` version of Table 303.10. Unfortunately, it comes in a fairly messy format as is typical, so we'll need to clean it.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Government datasets are rarely ready off the shelf.](excel_screenshot.png){width=785}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe'll need the `readxl` package. We can discard the first three rows with the `skip` argument of `read_xlsx()`. After that, we'll use one of my favorite functions which is `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package, which converts column names to snake_case. This has practical benefits beyond aesthetics: RStudio's autocompletion will fail if there are spaces in the column names. This will save you some typing! \n\nThere are some footers in the Excel file which we can remove just by filtering for non-NA rows in the `male` column. We'll also discard row 5 of the original file, which just contains column numbers, by filtering for `year != \"1\"`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\ntable_filename = 'tabn303.10.xlsx'\n\ndf =\n  # First 3 rows are unnecessary\n  readxl::read_xlsx(table_filename, skip = 3) |>\n  # convert title name to snake case\n  janitor::clean_names() |>\n  select(year, total = total_enrollment, male, female) |>\n  # Removes the footers\n  filter(!is.na(male)) |>\n  # remove unnecessary column number header row\n  filter(year != \"1\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe next issue is the unnecessary `\"\\1\\\"` or `\"\\r\\n\"` strings that appear in the `year` column. We'll use `str_replace()` from the `stringr` package to remove that. Then `year` needs to converted to numeric once those non-numeric characters are removed. While we are using `mutate()`, I'll create proportion male and proportional female columns. Then I'll select `year` and the two proportion columns, since we no longer need the full counts. I use the column selection helper  `starts_with()` from the `tidyselect` package, although with just 2 columns, this is not very useful. I'm highlighting its use for your more complex applications.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\ndf = df |>\n  mutate(\n    year = str_replace(year, '\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\', \"\"),\n    year = str_replace(year, \"\\\\r\\\\n\", \"\"),\n    year = as.numeric(year),\n    prop_male = male / total,\n    prop_female = female / total\n  ) |>\n  select(year, \n         # selection helpers from the tidyselect package\n         starts_with('prop')) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI plan to only plot every other year for a simpler graphic. There change is relatively gradual so showing year to year changes doesn't really matter much. My data goes from 1947 to 2023, so using the odd years is sufficient. \n\nAlso, we will later see that the trend is declining for males and rising for females, with a crossing point in 1979. I'd like to indicate this with a straight line at that point. I don't want to hard-code it, so I'll save this information as a one row tibble at this year called `final_male_df`. I'll do this calculation *before* I filter for odd years only, importantly.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nfinal_male_df = df |>\n  filter(prop_male > prop_female) |>\n  # Get maximal year in which male > female enrollment\n  slice_max(order_by = year)\n\n# Odd years only\ndf = df |> filter(year %in% seq(1947, 2023, by = 2))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe last piece of data wrangling we need is reshaping `df` into a long format. We want a single $y$-axis column, say `enrollment_pct`, so we'll pivot the `prop_male` and `prop_female` into a `sex` and `enrollment_pct` pair of columns. The `\"prop_\"` will then become unnecessary, so we'll remove it with `names_prefix = \"prop_\"` .\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlong_df = df |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(prop_male, prop_female),\n    names_to = \"sex\",\n    # Remove 'prop_' from new row names in sex\n    names_prefix = \"prop_\",\n    values_to = \"enrollment_pct\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Plotting\n\n## Our basic Geometries\n\nWe will start by adding points with `year` on the $x$ axis and `enrollment_pct` on the $y$ axis colored by `sex`. Then we add a segment from the male to female values using `geom_segment()`. To do so, we actually feed in the *wide* dataset `df` because it takes in a `y` and `yend` aesthetic for which we will specify `prop_male` and `prop_female`, respectively. The long version of the dataset no longer has these columns. However, the `df` dataframe does not have a `sex` column, so we don't want to feed in the previous aesthetics. Thus, we must include an `inherit.aes = F` argument to `geom_segment()`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlong_df |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(\n    # Use df to access prop_male, prop_female\n    data = df,\n    aes(x = year, y = prop_male, yend = prop_female),\n    # df doesn't have a sex column\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe next step is to add the vertical line for the transition point where more females than males enroll. We will feed in a new dataset again, the `final_male_df` row we saved. I want the line to occur on the first year in which female enrollment is higher, so I add one to the year. Once again, we'll need to not inherit the aesthetics. The reason I used `geom_segment()` instead of `geom_vline()` is that I wanted finer control over where the line starts and ends.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlong_df |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = df,\n    aes(x = year, y = prop_male, yend = prop_female),\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    # this is why we saved a 1 row tibble, not just the year\n    data = final_male_df,\n    aes(x = year + 1),\n    y = 0.25,\n    yend = 0.7,\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe last geometry I wish to add is `geom_image()`. The plot is fairly bare, so I wanted a transparent graphic representing education sitting in the bottom right. We'll have to load in the `ggimage` package. To add transparency, we [copy the technique here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60820565/is-there-a-way-to-add-an-alpha-value-within-geom-image-in-ggplot) and define a transparency function to pass into `geom_image()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlibrary(ggimage)\n\ntransparent <- function(img) {\n  magick::image_fx(img, expression = \"0.5*a\", channel = \"alpha\")\n}\n\nlong_df |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = df,\n    aes(x = year, y = prop_male, yend = prop_female),\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = final_male_df,\n    aes(x = year + 1),\n    y = 0.25,\n    yend = 0.7,\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    # create a temp. tibble to pass in aesthetics\n    data = tibble(year = 1998, enrollment_pct = 0.32),\n    aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, \n        image = 'generic_students.png'),\n    image_fun = transparent,\n    size = 0.3,\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI'll add in some styling to these geoms.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlong_df |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.1) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = df,\n    aes(x = year, y = prop_male, yend = prop_female),\n    inherit.aes = F,\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    linewidth = 2.2,\n    color = '#d95f02'\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = final_male_df,\n    aes(x = year + 1),\n    y = 0.25,\n    yend = 0.7,\n    color = '#d95f02',\n    linewidth = 1,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    linetype = 'dotdash',\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    data = tibble(year = 1998, enrollment_pct = 0.32),\n    aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, image = 'generic_students.png'),\n    image_fun = transparent,\n    size = 0.3,\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Colors and Scales\n\nAfter consulting [Color Brewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org), I settled on using [#7570b3]{style=\"background-color: #7570b3; color: white\"} for male and [#1b9e77]{style=\"background-color: #1b9e77; color: white\"} for female. For the bars, I used a transparent version of [#d95f02]{style=\"background-color: #d95f02; color: black\"}. Let's create a manual color scale to use these instead. We will remove the legend by specifying `guide = 'none'`. \n\nAlong the way, we can specify the breaks for the $x$ and $y$ axes, and use `percent_format()` from the `scales` package to get nice percent signs. The `expand = c(0, 0)` argument removes the automatic space added to the axes, so we can customize the limits manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\nlibrary(scales)\n\nlong_df |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.1) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = df,\n    aes(x = year, y = prop_male, yend = prop_female),\n    inherit.aes = F,\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    linewidth = 2.2,\n    color = '#d95f02'\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = final_male_df,\n    aes(x = year + 1),\n    y = 0.25,\n    yend = 0.7,\n    color = '#d95f02',\n    linewidth = 1,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    linetype = 'dotdash',\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    data =\n      tibble(year = 1998, enrollment_pct = 0.32),\n    aes(x = year, y = enrollment_pct, image = 'generic_students.png'),\n    image_fun = transparent,\n    size = 0.3,\n    inherit.aes = F\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::percent_format(),\n    limits = c(0.25, 0.73),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(1950, 2025, by = 10),\n    limits = c(1945, 2024),\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    breaks = c(\"male\", \"female\"),\n    values = c(\"#7570b3\", '#1b9e77'),\n    guide = 'none'\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLooks good. Let's fix up the labels. Importantly, I want to put the legend in the title itself. To do that, we use the `ggtext` package and add the HTML tags in the title. To render it properly, we must call `plot.title = element_markdown()` inside the `theme()` function. The HTML format is messy, but goes like this: `<span style = 'color:{your-color};'>{your-text}</span>`. \n\nThe same `ggtext` package lets me add line breaks to the caption as well, using `<br>`.

Since the end of WWII, males went from nearly 71% of all college enrollments to only 42%. This has massive implications for electoral trends given the impact of education on political leanings. But I'll leave that for Fivethirtyeight or its remnants to discuss.\n\nThe main takeaway of this blog post: Use text customization feature to replace existing plot elements like legends that can take up valuable space or contribute to a sense of clutter. Obviously if there are many categories, this is not advisable. But for something as simple as male versus female trends, Tobias had the right idea. \n\nI hope you also enjoyed the other tips and tricks with fonts, background images, dumbbell plot construction, and data cleaning Excel formats.\n",
