All of the below experience occurred during my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University. Teaching assistant responsibilities typically include grading and holding office hours. Occasionally, I was involved with preparing homeworks/exams with their solutions or proctoring exams. It isn't listed but I was also a private tutor for another PhD student in statistics in the fall of 2021.

I consider these teaching opportunities very valuable: it forces me to learn material I might otherwise skip over and reveals gaps in my own knowledge I didn't even know existed---the creativity with which students craft questions never ceases to surprise me. Moreover, I built valuable communication skills by working with students whose background ranged from high school to PhD level.
