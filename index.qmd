Welcome! My name is Akshay and I'm an incoming Postdoctoral Fellow at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Vancouver, Canada. I have just completed my PhD in Statistics \& Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, PA, which is where I also grew up. I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Economics from The Ohio State University.

My PhD thesis was about minimax optimal shape-constrained mean estimation, with extensions for sub-Gaussian noise, adversarial contamination, and non-parametric regression settings. During my PhD, I also worked on survival analysis techniques (multistate and joint models) with applications to a novel blood cancer immunotherapy, as part of a CMU-Novartis collaboration. I'm also a statistician at the Karikari Lab at UPMC, where researchers are exploring the use of blood-based biomarkers as diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's Disease.

My non-statistical hobbies include researching and investing in individual (value) stocks and video games--lately Escape from Tarkov and following competitive Advance Wars by Web matches.
